                USA Clean Master Commercial Cleaning primarily uses hot water
                extraction on synthetic wall-to-wall carpets. The reason for
                this is it simply does the best job of cleaning and rejuvenating
                today's carpets and it is great for environmentally friendly
                cleaning. Even the major carpet manufacturers recommend hot
                water extraction as the only method that satisfies the
                maintenance conditions in their warranties. Hot Water Extraction
                uses extremely hot water to clean the carpet from top to bottom,
                and even kills dust mites. Depending on your needs and the
                condition of your carpet, carpet foam, shampoo, or dry cleaning
                may also be appropriate. All methods of carpet cleaning use
                moisture, but carpet dry cleaning uses as little as possible.
                One of the advantages of carpet dry cleaning is its ability to
                improve the carpet's appearance while also drying very quickly,
                usually within an hour or two with adequate airflow in the room.

                Good question, with many answers. There are so many variables
                that any answer would be subject to changes. Pricing of cleaning
                a commercial carpet is especially difficult to estimate, since
                every area is very different. There are high traffic areas
                (walkways, corridors or halls), offices, conference rooms and
                other areas. The best thing to do is get an onsite estimate by a
                professional technician, who would inspect the carpet and
                understand exactly what would be required. The final price
                depends on the number of areas to be cleaned, their size, the
                amount of stains and the condition of the carpets. As a policy,
                we offer our clients the best value for money - excellent
                service standard, quality cleaning and competitive prices.

                In commercial cleaning, the areas and costs are defined by the
                size of the cleaned areas. The estimate given to you would be
                based on Square Footage (Sq. Ft.). In general, one area is
                defined as a single room up to 200 square feet. If you have a
                300 square foot room, it will be counted as two areas. However,
                since in commercial carpet cleaning rooms aren't necessarily
                defined, every area would be priced individually.

                Carpet cleaning can range anywhere from one hour and upwards to
                a day, or several days. It all depends on the size of the area
                that requires cleaning. The rule of thumb with commercial carpet
                cleaning is around one hour minimum for a small office (lobby,
                hallway and an office).

                My carpets were cleaned but look dirty again. What happened?

                If your carpet gets dirty again quickly after a professional
                carpet cleaning, it means that there was a detergent residue
                left on your carpet that new dirt is sticking to. Our Hot Water
                Extraction cleaning method leaves behind little or no detergent
                residue. This is actually one reason why it is better to leave
                stain removal to us rather than purchase a spot cleaner from the
                store. Commercially available carpet stain treatments are often
                difficult to rinse out adequately so that the residue attracts
                dirt and can make it look like the stain has returned.

                As stated above, each stain is different and requires a
                different approach. Some stains can be removed simply by going
                over them with the hot water extraction, and some require a more
                robust cleaning solution.

                When stains reappear a few days after a carpet cleaning, it
                usually means that the original spill had permeated the backing
                or even the carpet pad, and has wicked back up to the surface
                after the carpet has dried. Luckily USA Clean Master has the
                solution for this. So if we remove a stain, and it reappears in
                a few days, we'll be happy to come out and take care of it.
